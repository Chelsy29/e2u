E2 Planning and Response plans production well into the future and considers all inventory shortages or other critical situations. E2 Planning and Response always preserves the original demand pattern while a feasible plan is calculated on given constraints. This is very different from enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, which usually delay the production and procurement processes while considering constraints.

					<h3>FGI</h3></br>

					<h3>FIFO</h3></br>

					<hr>
					<h3>Fill or Kill (FoK)</h3></br>
						Term introduced by traders in the stock market to identify the option to buy or sell financial products immediately or not at all. A similar requirement has also become more popular in the consumer goods industry. FOK products have in common that they must be sold quickly at relatively low cost. Also, the high volume of sales orders makes it essential to avoid the need to handle back orders in case of stock shortages. Therefore, the demand needs to be satisfied in a certain time frame; otherwise, it will expire. E2 Planning and Response has introduced the “Expire Date” on demand level to free the allocated supply for other demands. See also E2PR.

					<h3>Firm Planned Order</h3></br>
						Defines a receipt of material without revealing how or from whom the material will be received. Firm planned orders therefore are process-unspecific. Solely the material, quantity, and the expected receipt date are known and fixed, but there is no information whether the material should be procured, produced, or transferred from another depot. See also Expected Receipts.
					<hr>
					<h3>Firm Supply (FS)</h3></br>
						Refers to expected material receipts that originate from either firm planned orders, inter warehouse transfers, purchase orders, or work orders. Firm supply is the supply side equivalent of primary demand and is generated using the command, Create Firm Supply. Apart from its origin, firm supply is characterized by its scheduled date and its reserve flag. The scheduled date is the anticipated date of arrival but might not be met if, for example, it’s sent late from the supplier. The reserve flag can take the values: “Both,” “Material,” “Capacity,” and “None.” It refers to the resource and material reservations that still must be done to further process the orders. If material needs to be reserved, at least lead time plus follow-up time passes until it becomes available. If capacity needs to be reserved, times according to the Bill of Capacities setup pass until material is available. According to the process model, capacity reservations become effective at the receiving depot and add to the time due to material reservations. Consequently, “None” implies that material supplied by a firm order will be available at the scheduled date, notwithstanding calendar deferrals. See also Inter-Warehouse Transfer, Firmed Planned Order, Purchase Order, Primary Demand, and Reserve Flag.
					<hr>

					<hr>
					
					<h3>Inter Warehouse Transfer</h3></br>
					<p>When determining the supplier, routing information that was stored in the MPS Supply Chain is evaluated. If parts are routinely obtained or can be balanced from another depot, E2 Planning and Response generates an inter-warehouse transfer (IWT). Proposals are for the expected receipts instead of PO proposals. These delivery requests are transferred to a separate output file and can be output via the IWT Proposals Report. The receiving depot’s IWT proposal generates demand in the delivery depot LT working days before the arrival date. The corresponding expected receipt in the receiving depot is adjusted if the delivery depot is unable or only partially able to deliver. An additional workday is added to the transfer time for parts that are produced in the delivery depot.</p> 
                    <p>For expected receipts from binding IWTs that are passed over the interface, no demand is generated in the delivery depot, as the stock has already been debited in the delivery depot. As soon as the stock is entered in the receiving depot, the corresponding binding IWT is automatically deleted in the execution system. See also E2PR, Expected Receipts, Purchase Order, LT, and IWT.</p>

					<h3>Inventory Intelligence</h3></br>

Analysis examples include identifying the quantity of stock available at each stocking location, the weeks of on-hand inventory and replenish rates for each stocking location, and so on. With inventory intelligence, a Vendor can avoid stock out situations, and resulting revenue loss, and optimize their working capital, and avoid or eliminate costly inventory write-offs.
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Inventory Reservation</h3></br>
					Also called IR; a planning feature that simulates a withdrawal of inventory without primary or secondary demand. Inventory reservations take precedence over any other demand. They can be used to model negative starting inventory.
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Inventory Turns</h3></br>
					It is a popular metric used to measure the number of times inventory is turned over or sold through in a given year.
                    <br/>A frequently used method to calculate inventory turns is to divide the Annual Cost of Sales by the Average Inventory Level.
                    <br/>For example:
                    <br/>Given that a company's cost of sales for the year 2014 is $36,000,000 and its average inventory is $6,000,000, the inventory turns is calculated as:  
                    <br/>$36,000,000 / $6,000,000 = 6 Inventory Turns
